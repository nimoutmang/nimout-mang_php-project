            Pizza is a worldwide favorite. The reason for pizza spread is that you can add anything to it and eat it anytime of the day and anywhere.
            The pizza originated in Italy and it is one of the favorite foods for adults and children.
            It was originally dough with topping of any ingredients as meat or vegetables that baked in the oven. Pizza developed to become more organized as Italians added sauce, cheese mozzarella and many other types of cheese. Such new way moved from Italy to other countries by Italian immigrants.
            Pizza arrived the Middle East and spread very quickly and become favorite.
            I’m not fond of pizza, I have pizza only once a month and when there are no options, this time I had dinner at the Pizza restaurant. The menu contained exciting varieties in terms of appetizers, pizza and pasta with a detail of the ingredients of each dish.
